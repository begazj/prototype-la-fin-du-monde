                  <h3>The Maquettes</h3>
                  <p>
                    Two maquettes for La Fin du monde filmée par l’Ange N.-D are
                    known. The term “maquette” in the case of a livre d’artiste
                    (artist’s book) means a model for the book in part or whole,
                    which may incorporate trial printings. One of the maquettes
                    is in the collections of the Bibliothèque Nationale de
                    France. It relates only to a small part of the book and does
                    not incorporate trial printings. The other, which is much
                    more complete and incorporates trial printings, belongs to
                    The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; it is bound in
                    with one of the exemplaires de tête (deluxe) copies, which
                    is digitally presented here with the New York maquette.
                  </p>
                  <h3>The New York Maquette</h3>
                  <p>
                    The later of the two maquettes, which is now in the
                    collection of The Met, is bound together in one volume with
                    a copy of the deluxe exemplaire de tête edition. The deluxe
                    edition was printed on high quality, handmade paper that
                    ensures more intense black for the type and more saturated
                    color for the images and colored inscriptions. The maquette
                    and the deluxe copy of the book are in a tooled leather
                    binding, which is a sculpted work in its own right. Signed
                    by Georges Leroux and dated 1972, it is housed in a blue
                    buckram case lined with yellow suede. The maquette is
                    printed on the lower quality paper used for the 1,200 copies
                    of the main edition. The paper for both the copy and the
                    maquette, “in-4 raisin” (in-quarto), measures 12⅞ x 10⅝
                    inches (32.8 x 27 cm).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Whereas the Paris maquette is Cendrars’s, the New York
                    maquette is Léger’s. It consists of twenty-nine leaves, or
                    fifty-nine pages. All but one of the leaves are two pages
                    folded together. There are eleven pages on which Léger has
                    variously worked with watercolor, gouache[?], and graphite,
                    interspersed with pages of text, as finally printed,
                    intervening.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The maquette begins with the book’s title page, printed
                    without color (fig. xx), followed by the title page of the
                    first chapter, also printed in black. Léger has used it like
                    a sketchbook page to try out two colored motifs: a plant
                    motif, white on a blue background, and a motif sometimes
                    referred to in French as a meduse (jellyfish), which is
                    outlined in graphite and colored in salmon pink. He has
                    sketched in the legs in various positions. These two motifs
                    would appear with another motif, a star, in chapter 6 in the
                    book as printed. They are the only images in the book that
                    do not simply accompany text or prepare the reader for text,
                    but over or under which text is printed, so that they catch
                    the eye in the process of reading.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Immediately following is the opening double-page spread for
                    chapter 1, printed in black, to which Léger has added
                    pictorial elements in yellow and upper-case lettering,
                    outlined in pencil and colored by hand in red above and
                    yellow below (Image xx). The lettering below spells “CAISSE”
                    (cash register), and is more quickly outlined and only
                    partially filled in with yellow. Underneath, written in
                    graphite, is a note giving chrome yellow as the exact color
                    to be used. This is clearly a new idea and would be used in
                    the book, where it directly challenges the reader to choose
                    between focusing on Léger’s word intervention in bright
                    yellow and the dense black type of Cendrars’s text. This is
                    the only place in the maquette where Léger also outlined in
                    graphite possible new pictorial elements. They are sketched
                    across the fragment of the “N” and the “GLI” of the word
                    “English” in red, and they echo the curve of the upper case
                    “G.” Léger would take them no further.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The chapter 1 double spread is one of five images where
                    pictorial elements, recognizable icons, and words combine to
                    tell visually Cendrars’s story; the others are the
                    double-page spreads for chapters 2 and 5, and the
                    frontispieces for chapters 3 and 4. When making the
                    maquette, Léger already had trial printings of these
                    storytelling illustrations in black supplied by Frazier-Soye
                    and was at the stage of deciding on the color to be added by
                    Richard, the colorist. His gouache and watercolor[?]
                    additions, made directly and impulsively by hand, are
                    antecedents to the models with color from which, using
                    pochoirs (stencils), the final images for the book would be
                    completed. There are instances of minor changes in color
                    choices between the maquette and the published version, and
                    one occasion where the change is more important: the
                    maquette leaf devoted to the double-page spread that
                    introduces chapter 5 (Image xx), where both pink and yellow
                    areas are brushed in. For the book as published, Léger would
                    expand the areas of yellow and get rid of the pink
                    altogether (Image xx).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One of the main claims for the book as a new departure for
                    early twentieth-century livres d’artiste is made by the
                    color images that are not storytelling. There are three
                    instances in which lettering is used almost exclusively as a
                    pictorial element in its own right and four where lettering
                    or cyphers are used both to arrest attention visually and to
                    convey information. In all the latter instances, before
                    coloring them in, Léger carefully outlined the cyphers or
                    upper-case letters in graphite and, to ensure consistency in
                    height and proportions, he used a ruler to box them in. The
                    first instance is the number code set out in white on a red
                    band at the end of chapter 2 (Image xx), which is inserted
                    after the text, as it would be in the book. The second is a
                    series of letters colored gray on a narrow band of yellow
                    that spill down the page spelling nothing (Image xx). The
                    third spells out the words “SPRICHT DEUTSCH” (German spoken)
                    white on a band of gray (Image xx). The fourth spells out
                    the words “SI PARLA ITALIANO” (Italian spoken) printed by
                    pochoir (stencil) in red (Image xx). These inscriptions are
                    superimposed over Cendrars’s text, so that they attract the
                    eye away from the text just as the yellow letters spelling
                    “CAISSE” do in the opening double page spread for chapter 1.
                    In the book as published, Léger would have them printed, not
                    across pages of text, but across the title pages of chapters
                    6 and 7, where their potential for distraction would be much
                    reduced (Images xx and xx).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The three compositions where letters are dispersed as
                    pictorial elements and fill whole pages do not challenge the
                    black type of the text directly, but in the book as
                    published are given pages of their own. In the maquette only
                    one of them has been tried out, the frontispiece of chapter
                    7 (Image xx). In the book as published, it would be on the
                    left verso page. Here it is on the right, recto page. The
                    image is very close to how it would be in the book as
                    published: all the color choices have been made, and Léger
                    is sure enough of the shaping of letters and pictorial
                    elements to outline them with pencil, changing his mind only
                    once, where at top right he lets the yellow spread outside
                    the outlined form, anticipating that form’s enlargement in
                    the book. The other two lettering compositions in the book
                    as published are just blank pages in the maquette. The
                    first, for chapter 4, was finally to be placed opposite the
                    image of the Angel N.-D with trumpet to lips on the recto,
                    the right page, but the blank here is on the verso, the left
                    page (Images xx and xx). Where the second was to be in the
                    book, on the verso page following the title page of chapter
                    6, is another blank (Image xx).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Opposite the provisional chapter 7 frontispiece, on the left
                    page, is the only instance in the maquette where Léger is
                    still early on in the process of conceiving a new
                    illustration (Image xx). The upper case letters here are
                    outlined heavily in graphite over more sketchy beginnings,
                    but no color is added. Léger is testing whether the letters
                    forming his “si parla Italiano” inscription can be dispersed
                    across the page to make a self-sufficient composition. The
                    letters spelling “SI PARLA” can be read arranged vertically,
                    crossed by those spelling “ITALIANO” arranged horizontally,
                    forming a kind of cross. He would decide not to take the
                    idea any further.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The fact that in the New York maquette there are blank pages
                    where in the book there would be lettering compositions at
                    the opening of chapters 4 and 6, and that the only idea left
                    unresolved in the maquette is for a lettering composition,
                    tends to confirm the evidence of the Paris maquette: Léger
                    decided to develop compositions that give letters a lead
                    pictorial role only after he had almost finished composing
                    the storytelling illustrations for chapters 1, 2, 3 and 5,
                    and was working with color. Additionally, Léger only uses
                    pencil outlining in the maquette when he is testing ideas,
                    most often when inserting inscriptions and using lettering
                    as a pictorial element. With the exception of the
                    double-spread opening of chapter 1, all the trial ideas in
                    the maquette that Léger is in the process of finalizing are
                    for chapters 6 and 7, the last two chapters of the book.
                    Altogether there is a strong argument for concluding that,
                    when Léger moved on from the earlier chapters for which he
                    had supplied storytelling illustrations and confronted the
                    question of how to give a visual accompaniment to Cendrars’s
                    narrative of the end of the world, he decided that
                    inscriptions and colored lettering compositions that
                    complemented but did not illustrate the text were what would
                    work best.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Cendrars’s text, as typeset, continues through the maquette
                    between the illustrations and the lettering compositions,
                    much as it would in the book, with one especially noticeable
                    exception. It involves chapters 3 and 4, where uncertainties
                    about how specific passages relate to each other in
                    Cendrars’s text may be betrayed, but where also Léger may
                    have simply been casual when fitting the text together and
                    made mistakes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The text of chapter 6 gets as far as the first three lines
                    of paragraph 35, leaving that paragraph on an unfinished
                    sentence. The last fourteen pages of the book, including the
                    whole of the text of chapter 7, are left out, although they
                    probably were already either printed or ready to be printed.
